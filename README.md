# RoboSim
A 2D simulation and abstraction of WPILib code for FRC 
### Using
This is in the very early stages of development and will not be ready for use for a while.

### About
This is a 2D simulation built using libGDX. To use this it is recommended to
not use the WPILib API for anything as this project will provide as much abstraction as possible to avoid that.
